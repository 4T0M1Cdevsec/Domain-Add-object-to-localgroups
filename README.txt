Domain-Add-object-to-localgroups
==========================
initial publish

This powershel script is an automated tool to add and remove domain objects from domain computers.
  ie. remove group object "groupAdmin" from the admin group. Add "standardUsers" to user's group.
This script provided the ability to select a single computer by host name or multiple computer in an OU.

I want to get this script to a point where anyone can use it and have it save a log file of completed and failed attemps at add/remove.
