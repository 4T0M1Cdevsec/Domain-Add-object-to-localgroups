# Domain-Add-object-to-localgroups
initial publish

This powershel script is an automated tool to add and remove domain object from domain computers.
This script provided the ability to select a single computer by host name or multiple computer in an OU.

I want to get this script to a point where anyone can use it and have it save a log file of completed and failed attemps at add/remove.

I was inspired to create this when I was told we needed to delete users/groups from the administrators group of our 400+ computers. 
Instead of going to each one, or create a new GPO, I wanted to create something that will give us a little more flexability.
After doing a little searching, what I was looking for didn't exist, so I have created.
